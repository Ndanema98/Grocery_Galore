# Milestone project 3
# Grocery Galore Survey Data Analysis

["Grocery Galore Survey Data Analysis"]() is a programme designed to manage the data of a fruit store.

This programme was built for a company which sells fruits. It will allow the user to input the daily sales data and the daily waste data of a specific fruit and add it to a google spreadsheet. The programme will also calculate the new stock levels of the fruits and calculate restock recommendations. Different validation methods are also present throughtout this programme to check whether the data being inputted is valid.

Spreadsheets are a great way to store data for companies because it allows them to organise and perform calculations on the data. This enables them to make important predictions and decisions, which on a whole will benefit them. 

This programme was built using knowledge gained from Python modules, for the purpose of completing my third Milestone Project for the Code Institute's full stack developer course. This programme is easy to navigate and easy to read, with a clear goal and aim.

 # Deployment
  - This code was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku. 

  - ## Steps for deployment:
   1. In the top right corner of the page click on the fork button. 
   2. The next page will show a forked version of my project.
   3. Create a new Heroku app.
   4. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order.
   5. Link the Heroku app to the repository. 
   6. Click on deploy.
